# Clawbot_Stacking_Challenge
This Clawbot was made to complete the Stacking Challenge using Python programming in VEXcode EXP. The drivetrain is connected to ports 6 and 10, so the robot can drive to cube locations and turn accurately. The arm motor is on port 9, and the claw motor is on port 8. The build was adjusted so the claw could pick up 3D-printed cubes without dropping them. The robot drives forward, picks up cubes, moves them to the stacking zone, and places them to build a stable tower.

Programming the stacking sequence needed careful timing and movement commands. One challenge was making sure the arm and claw worked together so the cube was always held securely. It took some testing to find the right amount of force for the claw to close and to place the cubes without knocking over the stack. After adjusting the motor speeds and testing each part, the robot could finish the task with stable stacking. Overall, the project was a success and taught us a lot about timing, motor coordination, and fixing problems in Python.
